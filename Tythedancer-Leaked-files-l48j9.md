Tythedancer continues to push the boundaries of contemporary art with her innovative and thought-provoking works. She is currently working on a new series of paintings that explore the theme of memory and its relationship to identity. Tythedancer's impact on the art world is significant, as she continues to challenge traditional notions of art and inspire a new generation of artists. Her works are now featured in museums and private collections around the world, and her influence is felt far beyond the art world. Tythedancer has been open about her struggles with depression and anxiety, but her online presence has also attracted toxicity and online harassment. Critics argue that her content perpetuates harmful stereotypes and objectifies women. Some fans, meanwhile, defend her right to express herself and criticize the double standards surrounding female sexuality.
